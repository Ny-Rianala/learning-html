        Attribute value
      </h2>
      <p>
        In this rule, attribute extends a tag and also it changes its behaviour. Here, it is about the way how to put the attribute. Besides, don't forget to use quotes because it must have quotes. However, don't put them inside another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't do this:
      </p>
      <p>eg:</p>
      <code>&lt;input type=text name=search></code><br>
        Do this instead:
      <p>
        This is the only way that we have to follow, have a look at the example below:
      </p>
      <code>&lt;input type="text" name="search"></code>
    </main>
    <footer>
      <a href="rules.html">Go back to the rules</a>
    </footer>
  </body>
